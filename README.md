# LearningMLandDL

## What is this?
This is a repo made for my AI course. 
At the beginning of the semester, we are using a udemy course to learn about the AI. 
We will also be taking an nvidia course. 

## What is in it?
Different small programs and learning exercises will be stored in this project. 

## How is it organized?
The different notebooks are split into basic, intermediate, and advanced. 
Admittedly, these were arbitrary based on how hard I felt the topic was when I finished and was looking back.

The neural network-related topics got their own folder, and includes tensorflow and keras tutorials.

Finally, the projects got their own folder so as to keep my work seperate from the provided materials. 

## Disclaimer?

This was made for me, not really to share. If you use this to learn something that's great, but I can't recommend enough you go take the course this came from on udemy. It is fairly inexpensive if you time it with a new account and it is really an exceptional course.

## How could I use it?

Each notebook was uploaded with it's own commit, so if you go back through past commits you should be able to see the basic order of things. Not Every notebook in the course was uploaded here, and I believe some of my project data isn't in here. As I mentioned this is mainly for me to come back too. These are python notebooks so you could run them locally, or you could use them in google collab (each notebook has a collab link) and run it in your browser which is what I did for the course. As a tip with the later material, you can enable a gpu in collab for free by changing the runtime session. Really helps with keras and more complicated models.
