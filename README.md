# LearningMLandDL

## What is this?
This is a repo made for my AI course. 
At the beginning of the semester, we are using a udemy course to learn about the AI. 
We will also be taking an nvidia course. 

## What is in it?
Different small programs and learning exercises will be stored in this project. 

## How is it organized?
The different notebooks are split into basic, intermediate, and advanced. 
Admittedly, these were arbitrary based on how hard I felt the topic was when I finished and was looking back.

The neural network-related topics got their own folder, and includes tensorflow and keras tutorials.

Finally, the projects got their own folder so as to keep my work seperate from the provided materials. 

## Disclaimer?

This was made for me, not really to share. If you use this to learn something that's great, but I can't recommend enough you go take the course this came from on udemy. It is fairly inexpensive if you time it with a new account and it is really an exceptional course.
